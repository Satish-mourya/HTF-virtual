# Inspiration💡

While working on a project 👨‍💻, we encountered a situation where we had to search 🔍 for an old code snippet 📝 that we had come across during a previous project. Unfortunately, this process consumed a significant amount of time ⏲️ as we struggled to recall and locate the specific snippet. This experience inspired 💡us to conceive a solution ⚙️ —a tool designed to efficiently store 📀 and organize code snippets. With this tool 🛠️, users can easily retrieve snippets, even if they provide only a vague description with The help of AI 🤖 technology for the search process, making it a seamless and time-saving experience 😇.

## What it does 💪


Effortlessly store any desired code/text 💻 snippet by simply copying ©️ it. Provide a basic description and add tags #️⃣ facilitate easy retrieval during searches 🔎. The tool employs sentence similarity pretrained model, akin to a browser's search 🌐 🔍 functionality, enabling users 🤵 to find snippets based on descriptions 📔 that closely match their queries. This streamlined process ensures efficient code management and quick access to the snippets you need. Additionally, the model runs locally 🏠 in the browser, eliminating the need to worry about any costs 💵 associated with its use.

## How we built it ❓🧠


We used React.js to develop 🧑‍💻 our front-end and enable interaction 🖱️ with the browser for seamless functionality. JavaScript was employed for various aspects of the project 📦. MongoDB served as the storage 💾 solution for user-specific snippets, ensuring accessibility from any computer or device. We integrated a pretrained model from Hugging Face 🤗 for sentence similarity. We used to frosty snow ❄️ ☃️ to make things better.

## Challenges we ran into 🧗

We encountered a little hiccup while attempting to connect ➿ to MongoDB from the browser 🌐 because, we didn't use a server side frame-work and integrated in the browser itself using Data API. It took us a bit of time to figure out the DATA API 🕜, but we eventually cracked 🧨 the code. Maintaining the indentation of the code snippets stored was like herding cats 🙀—trying not to lose indentation became a bit of a struggle. But fear not, we found our way through the maze 🧩 of tabs and spaces. Then came the quest for those elusive code snippets we once used or glimpsed in the past. The same headache 🤕 our tool is now working hard to cure ❤️‍🩹. Turns out, even coding has its own hide-and-seek 👾 challenges!
